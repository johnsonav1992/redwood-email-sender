PASTE YOUR HTML HERE BELOW THESE COMMENTS
BE SURE TO INCLUDE ALL YOUR IMAGES THAT THE HTML NEEDS LIKE SO:

<img src="cid:nameofimage-img" />

And then include the references to them in the script properties of this apps script like so:

Property: nameofimage-img, Value: fileId of that image stored in google drive. 

(the "-img" at the end of each image name is required for the code to find all the images it needs)
